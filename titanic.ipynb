    "# Titanic\n",
    "\n",
    "This is a quick response to some thoughts I had on [Chris Deotte's](https://www.kaggle.com/cdeotte) great kernel [Titanic using Name only](https://www.kaggle.com/cdeotte/titanic-using-name-only-0-81818/notebook), which I definitely suggest you look at if you haven't already.\n",
    "\n",
    "To sumarise quickly, his approach makes predictions based on the following rules:\n",
    "\n",
    "* All males die except boys in families where all females and boys live.\n",
    "\n",
    "* All females live except those in families where all females and boys die.\n",
    "\n",
    "Boys are defined as passengers with the title \"Master\", and families are defined as groups of people with the same surname.\n",
    "\n",
    "I was wondering what would happen if you group passengers sharing same ticket number, instead of passengers with the same surname. My main thought process for this was:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Passengers with the same surname may not come from the same family (could come from multiple families).\n",
    "\n",
    "* There may be important non-surname based groups, for example travelling friends, non-married couples etc.  \n",
    "\n",
    "So this notebook uses Chris' approach with ticket grouping and compares the results.\n",
    "\n",
    "UPDATE: Now using Chris' suggestion of the engineered TicketId feature."
