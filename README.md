# kaggle-titanic

My work for the Kaggle getting started [Titanic competition](https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic), a classification problem in which you must predict whether a passenger survived or lived the disaster based on features such as sex, age and passenger class. One of my approaches to the problem can be found on kaggle [here](https://www.kaggle.com/jack89roberts/titanic-using-ticket-groupings).
